all you need to do really is copy the code 
go onto inspect element by doing ctrl shift I 
press enter 
tada you now have your displays
i made this because  cant keep zooming into cockpit to see speed. i dont wanna keep clicking options to see my fps. and its nice to know how far ive travelled.
please feel free to edit the code to what you want. IN REPLAY MODE THE DISTANCE KEEPS ADDING UP
